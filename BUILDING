To build csvtotexyou need a acurrent version of mingw32 or VS Studio.

Type the follow commands from a terminal: (from root directory of programm)

cd build

cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" ..	# for 64 Bit VS build
-- or --
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..		# for mingw32 builds

In the case of a VS Studio build, you can open the generated solution / project file and build it through the Visual Studio gui.
